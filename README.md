Isidore README
==============

Isidore is a database and API for managing Ansible inventories. It allows for a
flexible tag base classification approach to group management, uses a database
(either MySQL or MariaDB) to store the inventory information, and provides an
API and command line interface for interacting with the database. Additionally,
it provides an Ansible inventory hook that allows for Isidore be used directly
as a dynamic Ansible inventory source.

Documentation is available in the [doc](doc/README.md) directory.
