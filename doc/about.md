# Appendix 1: About

Isidore started in 2023 as a project to handle a recurring issue with Ansible
inventory management: flat files quickly become cumbersome to manage and while
Ansible Automation Platform's inventory system is decent, it cannot be used
from the command line and really just serves as a cache for a bunch of
inventory sources that still have to be defined elsewhere.
